Hello, 
Here is the project I made for you.

To start the project first you nee to install all the modules.
Run this code

    npm run i


Postman Collection Link:
[https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5ab578db299aeec6ecd9](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5ab578db299aeec6ecd9)

you need to have a .env file in your derectory, and I am  giving you a example. for more, I will send you a authentication credentials for my DB in atlass, so you can test them easily.
 the .env will look like:

    MONGODB_URL= ****
    JWT_SECRET= *****


Then, as all modules are installed, now you can run this app by nodemon, or by node.

By node

    node index.js

By nodemon

    npm run i -g nodemon
    nodemon index.js

Now comes the functionality part. Here I am attaching a shared like of my postman. There you will find the way of working.

But primarily, all routes are using general REST procedure.
The only exception is the Post/meme creation part.

the you need to send all the data as a form data.
